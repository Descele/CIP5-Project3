Stanford University’s Code in Place—a global initiative inspired by CS 106A—equipped me with rigorous Python foundations through project-based learning. These projects reflect how I bridge code and urban analysis, transforming abstract concepts into tools for spatial problem-solving.

As an urban planner, I designed solutions that demonstrate Python’s versatility: automating workflows, analyzing datasets, and visualizing urban patterns. Each project here began as a technical exercise but evolved into a lens for interdisciplinary thinking—proof that programming isn’t just for engineers, but for anyone shaping cities.
